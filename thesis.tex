\chapter{Wildfly}
\label{wildfly_chapter}
In this chapter, the \textit{Wildfly Application Server} (former JBoss AS) will be described. Because of the size of the server, only specific part will be mentioned and description of its internal structure and configuration will be provided. Further information about Wildfly can be found at official website \url{http://wildfly.org/}. Wildfly 8 Documetation \cite{wildfly_doc} is used as the main source for this chapter.

Wildfly is one of the leading application servers in the area of enterprise solutions. From \cite[Getting Started with WildFly 8]{wildfly_doc}: ''WildFly 8 is an exceptionally fast, lightweight and powerful implementation of the Java Enterprise Edition 7 Platform specifications.''

Wildfly is \textit{Open Source} and is supported by the \textit{JBoss Community}. However, there is commercial version of Wildfly, \textit{JBoss Enterprise Application Platform}, which is licensed and supported by Red Hat.

\section{Structure of Wildfly}
The structure of Wildfly has been changed in past years due to maintainability and performance. Wildfly is formed by the wildfly core and set of subsystems. Subsystems are defined as on-demand services which are called by applications deployed on the server. Each subsystem is responsible for specific functionality.

The core of the server was significantly changed in the version JBoss AS 7. It consists of two parts \cite{jboss_as_book}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{JBoss Modules}: ''This handles the class loading of resources in the container.
	You can think of JBoss Modules as a thin bootstrap wrapper for executing
	an application in a modular environment.''
	\item \textbf{Modular Service Container (MSC)}: ''This provides a way to install,
	uninstall, and manage the services used by a container. MSC further
	enables the injection of resources into services and dependency
	management between services.''
\end{itemize}

The structure of the core described above has remained to the last version of Wildfly. The following diagram illustrates basic architecture of the Wildfly core \cite{wildfly_book}:

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/wildfly_core}
	\caption{Wildfly core architecture}
	\label{wildfly_core}
\end{figure}

\section{JBoss Modules}
\label{jboss_modules_sec}
Class loading is problematic domain in the context of application servers. Wildfly comes with the \textit{JBoss Modules} class loading system which provides effective way of loading classes into class path. \textit{JBoss Modules} is defined as follows \cite[Introduction]{jboss_modules_doc}: ''JBoss Modules is a standalone implementation of a modular (non-hierarchical) class loading and execution environment for Java.''

\textit{JBoss Modules} is implemented as delegating class loader model which is thread-safe, fast, and highly concurrent. Each \textit{JAR} which is loaded into class path is handled as a \textit{module}. A module must define list of dependencies only to modules it depends on. Modules are loaded only on request by an application. Thus, the performance of the application is dependent on modules which are currently used by the application.

Wildfly defines two types of modules \cite{wildfly_book}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Static modules
	\item Dynamic modules
\end{itemize}

The following diagram shows architecture of static and dynamic modules \cite{wildfly_book}:

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/jboss_modules}
	\caption{JBoss modules architecture}
	\label{jboss_modules_image}
\end{figure}

Static modules are defined in form of hierarchical directory structure. In Wildfly 8, static modules are located within \textit{JBOSS\_HOME/modules/system/layers/base} directory. A directory structure of a module is derived from the name and version of the module. The specific directory of the module contains module descriptor and resources required by the module (\textit{JAR} files).

The module descriptor is represented by \textit{module.xml} file. The following example shows module descriptor of the \textit{javax.batch.api module.xml} module \cite{wildfly_book}:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Example of a module descriptor, label = module_descriptor, language=XML]
<module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.3" name="javax.batch.api">
 <resources>
  <resource-root path="jboss-batch-api_1.0_spec-1.0.0.Final.jar"/>
 </resources>
 <dependencies>
  <module name="javax.api"/>
  <module name="javax.enterprise.api"/>
 </dependencies>    
</module>
\end{lstlisting}

The root \verb|<module>| element defines resources and dependencies of the module. 

Resources are defined within the\verb|<resources>| element which contains one or more \verb|resource-root>| elements. Each \verb|<resource-root>| element has the \textit{path} attribute which specifies path to the \textit{JAR} file. The example above uses only one resource, the \textit{jboss-batch-api\_1.0\_spec-1.0.0.Final.jar} file located in the module directory next to the \textit{module.xml} file. 

The \verb|<dependencies>| element defines dependencies for a module. A module is defined by the \verb|<module>| element which identifies specific module in the hierarchical directory structure. In the example above, \textit{javax.api} and \textit{javax.enterprise.api} modules will be resolved in the name resolution process.

Dynamic modules are defined for each deployment of an application. There are two approaches how to create dynamic module \cite{wildfly_book}.

First option is to add definition of a module and its dependencies to the \textit{MANIFEST} file within the \textit{JAR} of an application. For example in the Main class:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=]
mypackage/MyClass:
Dependencies: org.jboss.logging
\end{lstlisting}

\newpage
The second way is to configure \textit{deployment-structure.xml} by adding module dependency to it:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Configuring deployment structure file, label = dynamic_module_descriptor, language=XML]
<jboss-deployment-structure>
 <deployment>
  <dependencies>
   <module name="org.jboss.logging" />
  </dependencies>
 </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure>
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Wildfly logging subsystem}
Logging subsystem is responsible for displaying all logs which appear in the application server i.e. in every subsystem and user applications. The logging subsystem consists of the following parts: \textit{handler configurations}, \textit{logger}, \textit{the root logger declarations} and \textit{logging profiles}. Loggers declare set of handlers which send logs to defined destinations such as console, a file, network and others \cite[Logging Configuration]{wildfly_doc}.

The logging configuration can be defined in XML files (standalone.xml, domain.xml etc.), web console or command line interface. The following example illustrates a snippet of logging subsystem configuration from XML configuration file:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Configuring logging subsystem, label = logging_subsystem, language=XML]
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:logging:1.0">
 <console-handler name="CONSOLE" autoflush="true">
  <level name="DEBUG"/>
  <formatter>
   <pattern-formatter pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss,SSS} %-5p [%c] (%t) %s%E%n"/>
  </formatter>
 </console-handler>
 <logger category="com.arjuna">
  <level name="WARN"/>
 </logger>
 <root-logger>
  <level name="DEBUG"/>
   <handlers>
    <handler name="CONSOLE"/>
   </handlers>
 </root-logger>
</subsystem>
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Loggers}
Log messages are created by loggers. Definition of a logger consists of a category which is represented by package or class name. Whenever the logger tries to log a message, it first checks the level of the message. If the level of the message is greater than the level of the logger, a filter is applied to the log message.  The filter determines whether the log message is loggable or not according to filter rule. The loggign subsystem provides rich set of filter rules (expressions), detailed description of all filters and rules can be found in the Logging documentation \cite[Logging Configuration]{wildfly_doc}.

Wildfly logging subsystem defines the following set of logger levels \cite[Logging Configuration]{wildfly_doc}:

\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ALL
		\item FINEST
		\item FINER
		\item TRACE
		\item DEBUG
		\item FINE
		\item CONFIG
		\item INFO
		\item WARN
		\item WARNING
		\item ERROR
		\item SEVERE
		\item FATAL
		\item OFF
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Handlers}
Handlers represent next step in the log processing. If a log message is loggable, a handler processes the message e.g. sends the message to system console or stores the message to a file.

Logging subsystem provides the following set of handlers \cite[Logging Configuration]{wildfly_doc}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item async-handler
	\item console-handler
	\item file-handler
	\item periodic-rotating-file-handler
	\item size-rotating-file-handler
	\item syslog-handler
\end{itemize}

However, a custom handler can be implemented for user specific requirements.

\subsection{Defining custom handler}
Logging subsystem provides straightforward process of custom handler implementation. A custom handler is standard module in the JBoss Modules architecture \ref{jboss_modules_sec}.

The simplest way how to create a custom handler is to extend \textit{java.util.logging.Handler} class which is part of \textit{Java Logging API}. The \textit{Java Logging API} provides standard log handler lifecycle which is used to built a custom handler.

The following example shows custom handler class \textit{MyHandler.java}:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Custom handler class, label = custom_handler_class, language=Java]
package com.examples.logging
public class MyHandler extends Handler {
	@Override
	public void publish(LogRecord record) {
		//do something with log
	}
	
	@Override
	public void flush() ...
	@Override
	public void close() ...
}
\end{lstlisting}

The next step in custom handler implementation is to create \textit{module.xml} file with the following configuration:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Custom handler module descriptor, label = custom_handler_module_descriptor, language=XML]
<module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.3" name="com.examples.myhandler">
 <resources>
  <resource-root path="myHandler.jar"/>
 </resources>
 <dependencies>
  <module name="org.jboss.logging"/>
 </dependencies>    
</module>
\end{lstlisting}

Then the \textit{myHandler.jar} with the \textit{module.xml} file is placed to proper module directory, which is \textit{JBOSS\_HOME/modules/system/layers/base/com/examples/myhandler/main}.

Final step of the custom handler implementation is to add the custom handler to the logging subsystem configuration:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Adding custom handler to the logging subsystem configuration, label = custom_handler_logging_subsystem, language=XML]
 <custom-handler name="MyHandler" class="com.examples.logging.MyHandler" module="com.examples.myhandler">
  <level name="DEBUG"/>
 <formatter>...</formatter>
 </custom-handler>
\end{lstlisting}

After all previous steps, the \textit{MyHandler} will be used for processing of log messages in Wildfly.

\chapter{Byteman}
This chapter aims to introduce \textit{Byteman}, a bytecode manipulation tool, and its use in Java applications. Fundamental principles, functions and structure of Byteman will be described.
At the end of the chapter, an example of simple java application will be provided in order to understand bytecode injection which Byteman uses. More detailed documentation, tutorials and guidelines 
which cover almost every aspect of Byteman can be found in different versions at official website \url{http://byteman.jboss.org/}. Primary source for this thesis is Byteman documentation 3.0.0 \cite{byteman_doc}.

\section{Introduction to Byteman}
Byteman is a bytecode manipulation tool which uses a bytecode injection\footnote{Bytecode injection (or bytecode instrumentation) is a process of modifying the actual bytecode of a class} in order to change a java application as it is being loaded by \textit{Java virtual machine} or while the application is running \cite[Introduction to Byteman]{byteman_doc}.

Because of the bytecode injection, there is no need to change the original source code nor to recompile or redeploy the application itself. As it was mentioned, it is possible to add, replace or remove injected code at runtime while the application continues in execution. Byteman also provides a way to inject code into the Java language by modifying classes such as \textit{java.lang.Thread} and other classes from \textit{java.lang} package. Byteman uses simple scripting language called \textit{Event Condition Action} (\ref{subsec:eca_sec}) rules to determine how the original Java code should be transformed according to event and condition.

The original purpose of Byteman was to provide a mechanism for automation tests used in multi-threaded and multi-JVM Java applications using a technique called fault injection. Byteman can be used to inject faults which cause an application to invoke unusual or unexpected methods which are required for certain test scenarios. There are four areas supported by Byteman in automation testing \cite[Introduction to Byteman]{byteman_doc}:

\begin{itemize}
   \item tracing execution of specific code paths and displaying application or JVM state
   \item subverting normal execution by changing state, making unsche-duled method calls or forcing an unexpected return or throw
   \item orchestrating the timing of activities performed by independent application threads
   \item monitoring and gathering statistics summarising application a-nd JVM operation
\end{itemize}
However, the concept of bytecode injection involves Byteman in much larger scope of use apart from the testing area. The rule engine \ref{sec:rule_engine}, which forms the core of Byteman, is able to inject bytecode into almost every place in a call stack of a running java application. Thus the capability of bytecode injection enables manipulation of a Java program without any limitations in the design of the language (e.g. access level modifiers).

Byteman offers a suite of built-in operations and conditions in order to support activities and tasks emphasized above. Built-in operations (such as delays, waits, countdowns, flag operations and signals) are mainly used for coordination of threads in multi-threaded applications where multiple threads run with no order and it is needed to control the flow of particular threads.

To simplify process of using Byteman in common use or in the test automation, the Byteman rulecheck plugin and the BMUnit proje-cts were created in later releases of Byteman.

Byteman rulecheck plugin\footnote{\url{https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/CheckingYourBytemanRuleScriptsUnd-erMaven}} is a maven plugin which consists of a rule parser and a type checker. It runs the rule parser and type checker before every execution of any maven test to ensure that rules are still valid when a test code is modified.

BMUnit\footnote{\url{https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/BMUnitUsingBytemanWithJUnitOrTest-NGFromMavenAndAnt}} is a java library which provides integration of Byteman with the two most used test frameworks, JUnit\footnote{\url{http://junit.org/}} and TestNG\footnote{\url{http://testng.org}}. BMUnit uses java annotations to load Byteman agent into JVM during tests, and to specify which rules should be installed by the agent before a test run (and uninstalled after test is completed).

Byteman is an \textit{Open Source} project and plays important role in \textit{JBoss Community}. It helps other JBoss projects with test automation and quality assurance.

\section{The Byteman Rule Language}
This section introduces fundamentals of the Byteman Rule Language, its syntax, semantics and functionality. The Byteman Rule Language is the only way how to inject bytecode into Java applications via Byteman. Understanding of the Byteman Rule Language is required in order to write Byteman rule scripts which form the core functionality of this thesis. The following text is mainly focused on such parts of the Byteman Rule Language which are used in this work. Full description of the Byteman Rule Language is included in Byteman documentation \cite[The Byteman Rule Language]{byteman_doc}.

\subsection{Event Condition Action Rules}
\label{subsec:eca_sec}
According to \cite{eca}: ''Event Condition Action (ECA) languages are an intuitive and powerful paradigm for programming reactive systems.'' 

The Byteman Rule Language is built on the Event Condition Action language and adopts its core features. Byteman employs ECA rule engine to inject bytecode at specified location during execution. The whole process of the bytecode injection is done by strict and unambiguous steps which arise from the ECA language.

A set of rules is defined in Byteman script which is a file with a \textit{.btm} suffix. Rules are used to determine how a specific part of an application should be transformed at runtime. A rule comprises three components, event, condition and action, which have the following semantics\cite{eca}:

\begin{enumerate}
\label{itm:eca_if_then}
   \item when \textit{Event} occurs
   \item if \textit{Condition} is verified
   \item then execute \textit{Action}
\end{enumerate}

The ECA formalism provides a clear and easy-to-understand way how the bytecode injection should be performed without ambiguity.

Syntax of the rule consists of several parts which can be parsed by the rule engine. The following code snippet illustrates rule scheme and its structure \cite[Rule Events]{byteman_doc}:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Byteman rule scheme, label = byteman_scheme]
# rule skeleton
RULE <rule name>
# comment line in rule body
CLASS <class name>
METHOD <method name>
BIND <bindings>
IF <condition>
DO <actions>
ENDRULE
\end{lstlisting}

Comments in Byteman script can be placed either between definitions of rules or within the rule body. Comment line begins with \textit{\#} symbol and must start and end with new line to be parsed correctly.

A rule starts with a name placed after the \textit{RULE} keyword. The name can have any form of a character sequence which length is at least one non-white space character. Rule names can be duplicated, however, it causes ambiguity in debugging rule scripts. The rule name is the only identifier if an error occurs while parsing, type checking, compilation or execution of the rule.

\subsection{Rule events}
\label{subsec:rule_events}
A rule event is an event related to an event part of the ECA language specification \ref{itm:eca_if_then}. Byteman specifies the rule event as a \textit{location} in a target \textit{method} within a target \textit{class} \cite[Rule Events]{byteman_doc}. There are three types of target method: \textit{a static method}, \textit{an instance method} and \textit{a constructor}. Implicit location is \textit{AT ENTRY} if location was not specified.

Target class and target method are defined after the \textit{CLASS} and \textit{METHOD} keywords and must be in defined order on separate lines. The class name describes a class with or without the package specification. The method name can be defined either as a plain name or as a name with arguments and return type. The constructor method is defined by the special string \verb|<init>| in the method name.

The following code is an example of the rule event specification:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Rule event specification, label = rule_event_code]
#Log CMTTxInterceptor - invoke in our tx
RULE logCMTTxInterceptor.invokeInOurTx
CLASS org.jboss.as.ejb3.tx.CMTTxInterceptor
METHOD invokeInOurTx(InterceptorContext, TransactionManager, EJBComponent)
AT ENTRY
...
ENDRULE
\end{lstlisting}

For the rule above, only one trigger point will by inserted into the class \textit{CMTTxInterceptor} from package \textit{org.jboss.as.ejb3.tx}. The triggermethod is the method with name \textit{invokeInOurTx} and list of three parameters: \textit{InterceptorContext}, \textit{TransactionManager} and \textit{EJBComponent}. Note that the package qualification of all method parameters is omitted. The type checker will look up the package of each parameter of the matched method. Same approach applies for the return type of the method. Inner classes can be located with \textit{\$} expression e.g.: \textit{my.package.OuterClass\$InnerClass}.

The rule event can employ any class of a Java application except the following classes:

\begin{itemize}
   \item classes in package \textit{java.lang}
   \item classes belonging to the Bytemam itself (\textit{org.jboss.byteman} package)
\end{itemize}

Injecting into Java classes is not allowed by default. Nevertheless, this option can be disabled by configuring the Java agent (here will be reference to Java agent section).

The example above uses the \textit{AT ENTRY} location specifier. Byteman includes rich set of location specifiers for the rule events. The following list of location specifiers is used in this work, for the full set of location specifiers, see section \cite[Location Specifiers]{byteman_doc}.

\begin{itemize}
\item	AT ENTRY
\item	AT EXIT
\item	AT LINE \textit{number}
\item	AFTER WRITE \textit{\$var-or-idx [count | ALL ]}
\item	AT INVOKE \textit{[ type .] method [ ( argtypes ) ] [count | ALL ]}
\item	AFTER INVOKE \textit{[ type .] method [ ( argtypes ) ][count | ALL ]}
\end{itemize}

Location specifier must be placed after the \textit{METHOD} specifier. If location specifier is omitted, the rule engine uses the \textit{AT ENTRY} location specifier.

An \textit{AT ENTRY} specifier defines a trigger point before the first bytecode instruction of a target method. If the target method is the constructor method, the trigger point is added immediately after the call to super constructor or to call to alternative constructor.

An \textit{AT EXIT} specifier defines a trigger point after the last bytecode instruction of the target method. The last bytecode instruction is a return statement which is responsible for exiting the target method in standard program flow. Standard program flow is the flow where no exception has occurred during method execution.

An \textit{AT LINE} specifier defines a trigger point before the first bytecode instruction which has source code line number greater than or equal to the line number argument provided in the specifier. The line number argument must be text which can be parsed to an integer number. If executable code does not exist at or after the line number, no trigger point will be inserted.

An \textit{AFTER WRITE} specifier starts with a \textit{\$} prefix and continues with local variable name, parameter name or parameter index of the target method. It locates a trigger point after the bytecode instruction which is responsible for the assignment of the named variable, parameter, or the parameter at specified index. The count argument defines the \textit{Nth} assignment to the variable, the default value is 1.

An \textit{AT INVOKE} specifier locates a trigger point before the first instruction which invokes a method provided as an argument of the specifier. Trigger point can be an invocation of a method or a constructor within the target method. The name of the invoked method can be described with or without package qualification. Method parameters are expressed as a list of parameters types separated by comma. Parameter type may contain package qualification or the package is inferred by the type checker.

An \textit{AFTER INVOKE} specifier locates a trigger point before the first instruction which follows an invocation of a method provided as an argument of the specifier. Method description follows same rules as in the \textit{AT INVOKE} specifier.

\subsection{Rule Bindings}
\label{subsec:rule_bindings}
The rule binding specification is used for binding values to variables in a context of a rule. It is possible to assign a value to a new variable or reassign an existing variable. The context of the rule provides access to methods and fields of target class instance (if the target method is not static) and local variables in the scope of the trigger method. The assignments are performed each time the rule is triggered \cite[Rule Bindings]{byteman_doc}. The following example shows simple binding in the rule body: 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Rule binding specification, label = rule_binding_code]
RULE logChainInitiationObserver.onMessage
CLASS org.apache.cxf.transport.ChainInitiationObserver
METHOD onMessage(Message)
AT ENTRY
BIND bindMessage:Message = $1;
IF bindMessage != null
DO ...
ENDRULE
\end{lstlisting}

Binding defined in the rule above starts with the \textit{BIND} keyword which is followed with the variable \textit{bindMessage} on the left side, and the value on the right side. The assigned value is the value of the target method parameter at index 1. The type \textit{Message} of the \textit{bindMessage} variable is defined between the ":" character and "=" operator. If the type specification of the variable is omitted, it will be inferred from the type of the \textit{\$1} value. If there is more than one binding, each binding is ended with semicolon.

\subsection{Rule Expressions}
\label{subsec:rule_exp}
Rule expressions can be used in the rule body and provide several operations such as method invocations, built-in calls and field references. Byteman defines the following set of expressions \cite[Rule Expressions]{byteman_doc}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item references to previously bound variables
	\item references to the trigger method recipient or parameters
	\item references to the local variables in scope at the trigger point
	\item references to special variables:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=]
$!, $^, $#, $*, $@, $CLASS and $METHOD
\end{lstlisting}
	\item static field references
	\item primitive literals
	\item field accesses
	\item static or instance method invocations
	\item built-in operation invocations
\end{itemize}

It is possible to combine simple expressions to construct complex expressions using standard Java operators:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=]
+, -, *, /, %, &, |, ^, &&, ||, !, =, ==, !=, <. <=, >, >=, new, etc.
\end{lstlisting}

A reference to a trigger method instance is provided by the \textit{\$0} symbol. If the trigger method is a static method, the \textit{\$0} expression is invalid. A reference to the trigger method parameters is provided by the \textit{\$} symbol and index (1, 2, 3...). Index specifies position of a parameter in the trigger method.

A \textit{\$CLASS} special variable provides a \textit{String} representation of the full package qualified class whose method is the target of a rule. In most cases, the variable has the same value as the target class after the \textit{CLASS} keyword. However, if the target class is an interface, the value of the \textit{\$CLASS} variable can vary depending on interface implementation.

A \textit{\$METHOD} special variable provides a \textit{String} representation of the full name of the target method of a rule. Note that the method name is same as the target method specified after the \textit{METHOD} event specifier. The printed name of the method consists of full package qualified return type, bare method name and full package qualified list of parameters types.

A \textit{\$@} expression can be used only with \textit{AT INVOKE} location specifier. The value of the expression refers to an \textit{Object[]} array. The first slot in the array is an instance of a class whose method is specified in \textit{AT INVOKE} (if the target method is static, the value is null). Values in slots at indexes 1, 2, 3... are values of the target method parameters.

The following rule shows use of the expressions mentioned above:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Rule Expressions, label = rule_expressions_code]
RULE logPutData
CLASS org.jboss.as.webservices.deployers.WSComponentInstanceAssociationInterceptor
METHOD processInvocation(InterceptorContext)
AT INVOKE putPrivateData(Class, Object)
IF true
DO log($CLASS, "DEBUG", "Putting component instance to interceptor context:" +
"\nClass: " + $@[1] + "\nInstance: " + $@[2]);
ENDRULE
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Rule actions}
Rule actions can be represented by rule expressions \ref{subsec:rule_exp} or return or throw actions. A rule expression which is used in an action may have any type including void type \cite[Rule actions]{byteman_doc}. Several rule expressions are separated by semicolon. However, if an action contains only a single rule expression, the semicolon is omitted.

A rule expression can employ standard built-in methods (link) or methods defined in additional helper class (link) bound to a rule.

A return action starts with the \textit{return} keyword and can return a plain constant or a complex rule expression which is evaluated to a return value. Type of the constant or the complex expression must be assignable to the return type of the trigger method. If the type of the trigger method is void, the return value of the return action can be omitted \cite[Rule actions]{byteman_doc}.

A throw action consists of two parts, the \textit{throw} keyword and a constructor of a \textit{throwable}. A constructor starts with the standard \textit{new} keyword followed by a class definition which can be: \textit{java.lang.RuntimeException}, \textit{java.lang.Error}, subclasses of previous two classes or \textit{throwable} defined in the trigger method signature \cite[Rule actions]{byteman_doc}.

The following rule shows an example of rule action according to the definitions above:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Rule Action, label = rule_action_code]
RULE example of an action
CLASS org.jboss.resteasy.core.ResourceMethodInvoker
METHOD invoke(HttpRequest, HttpResponse, Object)
AT ENTRY
IF true
DO debug("Returning empty response.");
   return Response.noContent().build();
ENDRULE
\end{lstlisting}

The rule ''example of an action'' employs built-in operation \textit{public boolean debug(String message)}  and return action. Note that the type of the return value which is returned by \textit{Response.noContent().build()} must be assignable to return type of the trigger method.

\subsection{Built-In Calls}
Built-in calls are operations which can be used within a rule body. Byteman provides a set of build-in calls in order to write comprehensive rules without additional complexity \cite[Built-In Calls]{byteman_doc}.

Build-in calls are implemented as public methods of the default \textit{Helper} class. An instance of the \textit{Helper} class is assigned to a rule instance every time an instance is being created by the rule engine. Thus a rule can use all public methods exposed by the instance of the \textit{Helper} class.

Built-in methods can be recognized as methods of \textit{this} in the context of a rule. Thus, when the type checker finds a method without caller, the method will be type checked as a method of the \textit{Helper} class. At the execution time the rule engine invokes the implementations of the built-in methods on the instance of the \textit{Helper} class bound to a rule.

The architecture of the built-in calls allows simple extension of existing built-in operations. New built-in operations can be added to the rule engine by implementing new methods in the \textit{Helper} class. There is no need make changes in the parser,  type checker or compiler.

The build-in operations are grouped into the following categories\cite{byteman_doc}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item	Thread Coordination Operations
	\item	Rule State Management Operations
	\item	Trace and Debug Operations
	\item	Stack Management Operations
	\item	Default Helper Lifecycle Methods
\end{itemize}
 
Full list of built-in operations and its description can be found in the documentation of Byteman \cite{byteman_doc}.

\subsection{User-Defined Rule Helpers}
Built-in operations in the previous subsection provide default functionality for a user of Byteman. However, it is possible to define a \textit{CustomHelper} class which can override, replace or extend the existing default \textit{Helper} class \cite[User-Defined Rule Helpers]{byteman_doc}.

The only requirement for the \textit{CustomHelper} is to extend the base \textit{Helper} class. The \textit{CustomHelper} automatically inherits all built-in methods from the base \textit{Helper} if the methods are not overridden. A new method in the \textit{CustomHelper} must have \textit{public} access level modifier. Thus, a rule can use methods exposed by the \textit{CustomHelper}.
\newpage
The rule in the following example employs helper class \textit{MyHelper}:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Rule with user-defined helper class, label = rule_with_helper]
RULE rule with helper
CLASS org.jboss.as.ejb3.security.SecurityContextInterceptor
METHOD processInvocation(InterceptorContext)
HELPER com.examples.MyHelper
AT ENTRY
IF true
DO myMethod();
ENDRULE
\end{lstlisting}

When the rule above is executed, an instance of \textit{MyHelper} class is created and method \textit{myMethod()} is invoked in the rule action. \textit{MyHelper} class is defined as standard Java class:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = User-Defined helper class, label = rule_helper, language=Java]
public class MyHelper extends Helper{
	protected MyHelper(final Rule rule) {
		super(rule);
	}
	public String myMethod(){
		System.out.println("Printed text from MyHelper class.");
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

A \textit{CustomHelper} can be bound either to a single rule or to all rules (without specific helper class) defined in a rule script. Custom helpers are identified by the full package qualified class definition.

A \textit{CustomHelper} bound to a single rule is defined after the \textit{METHOD} event \ref{subsec:rule_events} in a rule definition.
	
A \textit{CustomHelper} bound to all rules without a helper class is placed at the start of a rule script before the definition of the first rule. The common \textit{CustomHelper} is applied to all rules in the rule script except rules with specific \textit{CustomHelper}.

For example, the first two rules use \textit{CommonHelper}, the third rule uses \textit{SpecificHelper}:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Rules with common helper, label = rules_common_helper]
HELPER com.examples.CommonHelper
RULE rule A ...

RULE rule B ...

RULE rule C with specific helper...
CLASS ...
METHOD ....
HELPER com.examples.SpecificHelper
ENDRULE
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Agent Transformation}
Byteman employs Java agent to modify bytecode of the target Java application. From \cite{agent_def}: ''An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through effectors.''

The Java agent uses package \textit{java.lang.Instrumentation} for bytecode instrumentation \cite{instrumentation}: ''Bytecode instrumentation is a valuable technique for transparently enhancing virtual execution environments, for purposes such as monitoring or profiling.''

The Byteman agent and rule scripts are loaded at JVM boostrap. When an application is launched, the agent analyzes application bytecode and looks for trigger points which are defined by the rule events \ref{subsec:rule_events}. If a rule event matches a location in bytecode, the agent inserts \textit{trigger call} into that location. A \textit{trigger call} is performed by the rule engine and consists of the following parts \cite[Agent Transformation]{byteman_doc}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item	the trigger method, i.e. the method which contains the trigger point
	\item	the rule which has been matched
	\item	the arguments to the trigger method
\end{itemize}

If there is more than one rule for the same trigger point, a sequence of \textit{trigger calls} will be added to the bytecode. The order of \textit{trigger calls} reflects the order of rules defined in a rule script. A special case is rules with an \textit{AFTER} location specifier \ref{subsec:rule_events}. In this case, \textit{trigger calls} are executed in reverse order in which rules were defined in a rule script.

When a program flow reaches a location with a \textit{trigger call}, the rule engine searches for the rule which is bound to the trigger call and executes it. At the start of the rule execution, the rule engine initializes variables defined in rule bindings \ref{subsec:rule_bindings}. Then, the execution continues in the ECA formalism \ref{subsec:eca_sec}: if the rule condition is verified, the rule action is executed.

The rule engine obtains an instance of a target method and method arguments from a \textit{trigger call}. To access the instance and method arguments in a rule body, \textit{\$0} (the instance) and \textit{\$1, \$2...} (method arguments) expressions are used \ref{subsec:rule_exp}. Local variables are also passed by the \textit{trigger call} and can be accessed with \textit{\$} symbol followed by a name of a local variable e.g. \textit{\$variableName}.

The agent also provides exception handler which is wrapped around the \textit{trigger call} in order to process exceptions which can be thrown during the execution of a rule \cite[Agent Transformation]{byteman_doc}.

\section{Rule engine}
\label{sec:rule_engine}
Byteman rule engine is heart of the Byteman, it executes rules to inject bytecode into Java application.. The following components form the Byteman rule engine: a rule parser, type checker and interpreter/compiler. The agent invokes the rule parser at JVM bootstrap in order to search for potential trigger points \cite[ECA Rule Engine]{byteman_doc}.

When a rule is type checked, the type checker needs to access properties of the target class and all classes (including fields, method signatures etc.) which the target class employs. For this reason, the rule must be type checked and compiled after the corresponding bytecode of the target class was loaded i.e. at the first time the rule was triggered. A positive side effect of the type checking process is reduction of cost as rules, which are not triggered, are not type checked and compiled.

Depending on the event specification, there can be one or more trigger points associated with a rule. However, if the rule specification identifies exactly one trigger point for the target class, the class can be loaded by different class loaders. Thus, the rule engine ensures that a rule is type checked for each trigger point.

If there is an error during type check or compilation, the rule engine informs user about the error and the \textit{trigger calls} will not be executed.

The rule engine uses \textit{helper adapter}, an auxiliary class, for the execution of a rule. The \textit{helper adapter} extends the \textit{Helper} class and provides additional functionality for the execution. The \textit{execute} method, which is invoked at the trigger point, is responsible for the rule execution itself.

When a rule is executed, a instance of the \textit{helper adapter} is created. The instance initializes the rule with all bindings fields to provide metadata for the trigger call. Then, the rule engine calls the \textit{execute} method to execute the rule.

A new instance of \textit{helper adapter} is created for each invocation of same rule, thus, undesirable interference of concurrent \textit{trigger calls} is avoided.

\section{Using Byteman in Java applications}
Using Byteman in a Java application means running the Java agent in the background of an application. For this purpose, the \textit{-javaagent} option must be passed to the Java virtual machine which runs the Java application. The Java agent is configured in the following format \cite[Running Applications with Byteman]{byteman_doc}:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=]
-javaagent:path_to_Byteman.jar=option1, option2, ...
\end{lstlisting}
Byteman agent provides set of agent options for different purposes, the following list shows several important options \cite[Available -javaagent Options]{byteman_doc}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item	\verb|script:scriptfile|
	\item	\verb|sys:jarfile|
	\item	\verb|boot:jarfile|
\end{itemize}

The \textit{script:scriptfile} defines Byteman rule script file which is loaded at JVM startup. The \textit{scriptfile} is the name of the file. Byteman agent enables multiple \textit{script:scriptfile} options in order to load more than one rule script.

The \textit{sys:jarfile} option provides loading a \textit{.jar} file whose classes are available on the system class path. This ensures that classes in the jar file can be found when rules are executed by the rule engine. The \textit{jarfile} is path to existing \textit{jar} file. This option is typically used for user-defined \textit{Helper} classes to be available in rules.

The \textit{boot:jarfile} option is similar to the \textit{sys:jarfile}. Only difference is availability of classes in the \textit{.jar} file on the bootstrap class path. This is required when bytecode is injected into classes from \textit{java.lang} package and other JVM classes.

The full description of all agent options can be found at \cite[Available -javaagent Options]{byteman_doc}.

\subsection{Example of Byteman in Java application}
The following definition of a java class represents simple Java application which will be used to show Byteman basic functionality:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Java class bypassed by the Byteman, label = class_use_case, language=Java]
package com.examples;
public class BytemanTest{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Inside the BytemanTest.main");
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
The class above contains only \textit{main} method which prints text "Inside the BytemanTest.main" to system output.

The next step is to create Byteman rule script \textit{script.btm} and definition of a rule which is responsible for injecting bytecode into the class above. The following rule is defined for the \textit{BytemanTest} class and its \textit{main} method:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Example of Byteman rule, label = rule_use_case]
RULE testByteman
CLASS com.examples.BytemanTest
METHOD main
AT ENTRY
IF true
DO debug("Main method bypassed by Byteman.");
ENDRULE
\end{lstlisting}
To run the application with Byteman, the \textit{-javaagent} option must be placed before the run of the application \textit{com.examples.BytemanTest}. The following example runs the application in Linux command line:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=]
> java -javaagent:${BYTEMAN_HOME}/lib/byteman.jar=script:script.btm com.examples.BytemanTest
\end{lstlisting}

Running the application with the command above produces the following output in command line:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=]
> java -javaagent:${BYTEMAN_HOME}...
Main method bypassed by Byteman.
Inside the BytemanTest.main
>
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Elasticsearch and Kibana}
This chapter briefly describes Elasticsearch and Kibana technologies which are used for storage and visualization of data. In the context of this work, the data represents log messages from Wildfly Application Server \ref{wildfly_chapter}. The aim of this chapter is to provide basic insight into Elasticsearch and Kibana and show how to configure and run them.

\section{Elasticsearch}
Elasticsearch is mainly known as search engine. From \cite{elasticsearch_defnitive_guide}: ''Elasticsearch is an open-source search engine built on top of Apache Lucene‚Ñ¢, a fulltext search-engine library.''

It is an abstract layer between complex \textit{Apache Lucene}\footnote{Lucene is arguably the most advanced, high-performance, and fully featured search engine library in existence today‚Äîboth open source and proprietary \cite{elasticsearch_defnitive_guide}} library and user applications. Elasticsearch does not require for its users to fully understand the complexity of Lucene, it provides API for working with Lucene in simple way.

However, Elasticsearch is not only search engine, it can be defined as follows \cite{elasticsearch_defnitive_guide}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A distributed real-time document store where \textit{every field} is indexed and searchable
	\item A distributed search engine with real-time analytics
	\item Capable of scaling to hundreds of servers and petabytes of structured and unstructured data
\end{itemize}

Elasticsearch is implemented in Java and packaged into standalone server. Access to the Elasticsearch server can be done in various ways, such as RESTful API\footnote{Representational State Transfer (REST) is architectural style, developed as an abstract model of the Web architecture \cite{rest}}, web client (Java, .NET, Python etc.) or command line interface.
